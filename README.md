## Interactive Navigation Menu with Scroll and Hover Effects
## Objective
An interactive navigation menu that stays fixed at the top of the page and enhances user experience by changing its style on scroll and hover. Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.This Interactive Navigation Menu features a clean and modern design. It remains visible as you scroll through the page and changes its background and font colors based on scroll position. It also has hover effects on each menu item for a more dynamic user experience.

## Features:
1. **Fixed Position:** The navigation menu is always visible at the top of the page.
2. **Scroll Effect:** Changes background color and font styles when the page is scrolled.
3. **Hover Effect:** Menu items change color when hovered over.
4. **Responsive Design:** Adjusts to different screen sizes with a mobile-friendly design.

## How It Works
1. The navigation menu is styled to be fixed at the top of the page.

3. CSS adds hover effects to the menu items, enhancing user interaction when hovering over the menu.
4. The entire menu is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes, including mobile.
